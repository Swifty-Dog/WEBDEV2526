## Introduction
Calendify is a calendar application, aimed at startups, that allows employees to attend events and view them on their calendar after attending. Employees may also book rooms for various reasons. Administration may add more rooms, allowing the system to grow alongside the company.

## How to run
Run this command:

`npm run dev`

This command has been altered to run both the frontend and backend concurrently, to make the initial launch easier.

## Extra feature

We added a settings page. In this page, an employee can customize their experience in the forms of the following:
- Site Theme (Light/Dark)
- Accent Color (Blue/Purple/Orange/Yellow)
- Font Size (Small/Medium/Large/Extra Large)
- Language (English/Dutch)
